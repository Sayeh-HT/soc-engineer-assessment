# **Vulnerability Report Processing – README**

## **Overview**
This project processes a vulnerability report generated by the **OWASP Dependency-Check** tool. The Python script extracts vulnerabilities from a `report.json` file, sorts them by severity, removes duplicates, and outputs the results in a structured JSON format.

---

## **Steps Followed for Report Processing**

### **1. Prerequisites**
Before you can use the script, make sure that you have the following:

- **Python 3.x** installed on your system. You can download Python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- The **`report.json` file** generated by **OWASP Dependency-Check**, which contains the vulnerability data for your project.

### **2. Installing Required Libraries**
If you haven't installed the necessary dependencies, use the following command to install them via `pip` (Python's package installer):
```bash
pip install json
```

This is required to process the JSON data from the `report.json` file.

---

### **3. Process Overview**

The vulnerability report processing follows these steps:
1. **Loading the Report**: The `report.json` file is loaded into the script. It contains detailed information about vulnerabilities detected in project dependencies.

2. **Data Processing**: The script processes each vulnerability:
   - Extracts `vulnerability_name`, `severity`, and `file_names` from the report.
   - Ensures that **file names are unique** and sorted alphabetically.

3. **Sorting**: Vulnerabilities are sorted by severity, from **Critical** to **Low**.

4. **Output Generation**: After processing, the results are saved in a new file called `processed_report.json`, ensuring that:
   - There are **no duplicates**.
   - The **vulnerabilities are sorted** by severity.

---

### **4. Running the Script**

#### **Step 1: Prepare `report.json`**
Ensure that you have the `report.json` file generated by **OWASP Dependency-Check**. This file contains the detected vulnerabilities in your project dependencies.

#### **Step 2: Download or Copy the Script**
Ensure that the Python script, `vul-report.py`, is in the same directory as the `report.json` file, or modify the path to point to the location of your `report.json`.

#### **Step 3: Run the Script**
In your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing the script and `report.json`, then execute the following command:

```bash
python vul-report.py
```

This will:
- Load the `report.json` file.
- Process the vulnerabilities, ensuring no duplicates.
- Sort the vulnerabilities by severity.
- Output the processed report to a new file named `processed_report.json`.

### **5. Output File**

After running the script, you will find the processed report saved in the file `processed_report.json`. The output will be in the following format:

```json
[
    {
        "vulnerability_name": "CVE-2017-16116",
        "severity": "high",
        "file_names": [
            "crypto-random-string:1.0.0",
            "escape-string-regexp:1.0.5",
            "unique-string:1.0.0"
        ]
    },
    {
        "vulnerability_name": "CVE-2018-16492",
        "severity": "critical",
        "file_names": [
            "deep-extend:0.6.0",
            "static-extend:0.1.2",
            "extend-shallow:2.0.1"
        ]
    }
]
```

**Key Points**:
- **Vulnerability Name**: The identifier for the vulnerability (CVE, CWE, or custom).
- **Severity**: The severity level (Critical, High, Medium, Low, or Unknown).
- **File Names**: The list of affected files or dependencies, sorted alphabetically.

---

### **6. Script Breakdown**

#### **Loading the Report**
The `load_report()` function:
- Reads the `report.json` file.
- Checks if the data is in dictionary format and contains the `dependencies` key.
- Returns the `dependencies` list for processing.

#### **Processing the Vulnerabilities**
The `process_vulnerabilities()` function:
- Iterates through each item in the `dependencies` list.
- Extracts `vulnerability_name`, `severity`, and `file_names`.
- Uses a **set** to store file names, ensuring no duplicates.
- Sorts vulnerabilities by severity (Critical → High → Medium → Low → Unknown).

#### **Writing the Output**
The `write_output()` function:
- Takes the processed vulnerabilities and writes them to `processed_report.json` in the required format.

---

### **7. Customization and Enhancements**

The script is designed to be easily customizable:
- **Sorting Logic**: The script currently sorts vulnerabilities by severity. You can modify the sorting criteria (e.g., sort by vulnerability name or file name).
- **Error Handling**: The script handles missing or malformed data gracefully by assigning default values (e.g., "unknown" for missing severity).

---

### **8. Known Issues**
- **Large Reports**: For very large vulnerability reports, performance may be an issue. Future optimizations could include parallel processing or caching for better performance.
- **Incomplete Data**: If the `report.json` is missing critical fields (e.g., severity or file names), the script will fill in default values, but some information may be missing.

---

### **9. Final Thoughts**

This script provides an automated way to process vulnerability reports generated by OWASP Dependency-Check, ensuring that the data is clean, sorted, and free of duplicates. It outputs a structured report that can be easily analyzed and shared with your security team for remediation.
